# Note

I'm done with this. If someone wants to maintain it send me a note and I'll transfer the repo. Or just fork it, or whatever.

## Instructions

Make sure the files are in a folder called `SocialAnalytics` if they're not already  
Put the folder in your `/plugins/` directory  
Tell `/config.php` to use it with: `addPlugin('SocialAnalytics');`  
You should now have a 'Social Analytics' item in your GNU social left navigation.
